🌟 WELCOME TO THE A-TEAM GAME!!! 🚀

At the 4th week of my 14-week intensive Full Stack Programming Bootcamp at Code For All_ 🎓, we (Code cadets) embarked on a thrilling challenge: to develop a game showcasing the fresh skills acquired until that point, in 10 days!

🕹️ This game was brought to life by a team of 5 members 🤝, and we sprinted against time with a mere 10 days to develop and deliver this project. Having our regular classes throughout the day, we juggled absorbing new content and channeling our creativity into this project, in order to deliver it before the deadline!

💻 Developed in Java, we used the power of a fantastic library called "simple-graphics" as our GUI, this library was created by the brilliant minds at Code For All_ (Check it out here: https://github.com/academia-de-codigo/simple-graphics)
