WELCOME TO THE A-TEAM GAME!!!

At the 4th week of my 14 week intensive Full Stack Programming Bootcamp at Code For All_ we (Code cadets) were challanged to develop a game using the fresh skills that we
gathered until that point!

This game was developed in teams of 5 members, and we had 10 days to deveolp and deliever this project, at the same time we were having our normal classes during
tha day, so after a day filled with new contents to study, we had to give our best in order to deliever this project before the deadline!

This project was devolped in Java, and we used a library created by Code For All_ called "simlpe-graphics" as our GUI (https://github.com/academia-de-codigo/simple-graphics)
